    Passive - Runic Blade
  </h2>
  <section class="sections">
    <br>
    Riven's blade gains a Charge for 6 seconds every time she uses an ability (stacks up to 3 times). Riven's basic attacks consume a Charge to deal 25% − 50% (based on level) Attack damage bonus physical damage.

    Runic Blade is affected by critical strike modifiers.

    Q - Broken Wings
  </h2>
  <section class="sections">

    <br>
    Riven Dash dashes towards the target nearest to the cursor or in the direction she is currently facing, dealing physical damage to all enemies in front of her. Broken Wings can then be reactivated twice within the next 4 seconds, with the second
    cast refreshing the timer.
    <br>
    <br>
    The third cast knocks up and damages all enemies around Riven in an expanded radius. The third cast is also the only cast able to dash over terrain, and can do so longer than its normal range.
    <br>
    <br>
    Each Broken Wings cast causes her next basic attack to occur more quickly. This is not considered a basic attack reset.
    <br>
    <br>
    PHYSICAL DAMAGE:» 15 / 35 / 55 / 75 / 95 (+ 45 / 50 / 55 / 60 / 65% AD)
